									<h3>Module Overview </h3>
									<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a popular approach to software development that uses objects and classes to organize code. Students will learn how to create classes and objects in Python, and use them to manipulate data. The module covers advanced topics like inheritance and polymorphism, which are used to design complex programs. Upon completion, students will have the skills to design and implement their own OOP programs. </p>	
									<h3>Learning outcomes </h3>
									<li>Appraise and critically evaluate object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms. </li>
									<li>Design and implement programs that demonstrate appropriate use of object-oriented design principles. </li>
									<li>Select and use appropriate data structures for a given problem. </li>
									<li>Propose object-oriented solutions using an appropriate modelling language, such as UML. </li>
									</ol>	
									<hr />
									<header class="major">
										<h2>Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the OO Programming Paradigm </h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>The first unit of the module introduces the object oriented programming paradigm, the syntax and the method used to form classes in python. Also introducing the 5 major features of object oriented programming: </p>
									<li>Classes: OOP is based on the group of classes which are templates or blueprints that define the properties and behaviour of an object. </li>
								        <li>Encapsulation: is a way to hide the implementation details of an object from the outside. </li>
								        <li>Inheritance: allows for a new class to be based on an existing one. Inheriting the properties and methods. </li>								
								        <li>Polymorphism: allows objects to change to take on different forms or types </li>								
								        <li>Abstraction: is the process of removing unnecessary detail from an object, leaving only the essential characteristics. </li>
								        <br>
								        <h3><u>Article review </u></h3>
								        <p> The article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021) discusses the topic of E-portfolios. With the benefits of making e-portfolios for students being explored in detail. The article discusses the effect that e-portfolios have on the enhancement of student experience and engagement to higher learning programs. This article is one of the first studies into finding the true value of the implementation of an e-portfolio of which presented many less commonly associated benefits such as the development of professional confidence. Personally, as a post graduate student making an e-portfolio for the first time I expected the benefits to be simply as a showcase of work and progress, however according to this article the act of building the portfolio itself helps to build many professional skills and serves as form of revision for the content learned during the course. This can help build confidence for students as it shows a clear progression in skills over duration of the module. </p>

								        <h3><u>Discussion Forum </u></h3>
									<p>The research paper by Padhy et al. (2018) breaks down the object-oriented metrics that influence the reusability and its overall assets. Eleven key assets have been identified to affect the reusability of object-oriented software apart from programming code. Six of these assets have been identified to have greater influence on the overall reusability compared to other assets, these have been ranked in detail and shown below. </p>								
									<ol>
									<li> Requirement analysis (RA): Its essential to understand the parameters for which a project needs to take place. Without this effective progress cannot be started. </li>
                      							<li> Knowledge requirements (KR): The knowledge in the form of experiences, ideas and reasoning are key assets that are applicable to any type of project. </li>								
									<li> Design Patterns (DP): The recycling of older and used designs when applicable can help to speed up the creation of new projects. </li>
									<li> Algorithm used in the programs (AP): The reuse of algorithms can help to aid developers and makes the designing new programs quicker and easier. </li>
									<li> Architecture driven approach (ADP): The general structure of a project can be reused in similar projects to help speed up the planning and development stages. </li>								
									<li> Documentation in project (DIP): The documentation process helps to keep track of all development aspects this can directly be used to contribute to reducing time for future projects by boosting knowledge base of a development team. </li>								
								        </ol>
									<p> The remaining 5 unranked assets include: Modules in the program (MIP), Service Contracts (SC), Test Cases/ test design (TCTD), Models in the project (MIP), Used in the data project (UD). These clearly have a role in the reusability of software however when compared to the 6 ranked I personally feel these have a smaller impact. </p>

									<h3><u>Artefacts: Protected and unprotected variables </u></h3>
									<p>In OOP class attributes can be either protected or unprotected variables. An unprotected variable can be accessed or modified from any point in the program while a protected variable can only be accessed and modified within its the class and subclasses. </p>									
									<p>The following program shows a contact book with the application of protected and unprotected variables. So that some information is public such as the name while the phone number and email are private. </p>

										<h2>Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python </h2>
									</header>
									<p>The second unit discusses the initial steps to start OOP within python after the process of analysing the programs domain by applying UML designs of both use case and state machine diagrams. Use case diagrams in particular provide an important visual aid to understanding the different actor and main features present in a system. </p>

										<h2>Unit 3:  UML </h2>
									</header>
									<p>The third unit discusses the different types of UML diagrams and the importance of each of them, most importantly the class diagram. The class diagram is essential to be understanding on how to implement it as it is heavily involved in OOP coding. The third unit also provides a key understanding into the different stages of software development and the overall system design. </p>								
									
								<h3><u> Artefact :UML and development life cycles </u></h3>
									<p>UML is a modelling technique that shows the step wise details of components involved with the development of a system. UML models contain elements such as the use actors, classes and packages involved in a project. It is used to show visually a specific perspective. The two main types of UML diagrams are structural and behavioural diagrams. Structural diagrams show the different  elements present in the system while behavioural diagrams show the how the object in the system interact with each other to create a functioning system. </p>
									<p>Use case diagram is utilized at the requirement gathering stage of development. This is in order to identify the different scenarios present in the system. </p>								
									<p>Class diagram are used during the design stage to represent the different classes and objects present as well as the relationships between them. </p>								
									<p>Sequence diagrams are used during the development stage to show the different interactions between objects or components present in the system and how these occur. </p>								
									<p>Activity diagrams are used during the both the requirement and packaging stage to show flow of activities and decision paths present in the system. </p>
									<p>State diagrams are useful at any stage of development except the final packing stage. It is used the model the behaviour of object in the system. This shows the different states of an object or component can be in and the events that cause these changes.</p>

								<h3><u>Discussion Forum</u></h3>
								<p><u> Summary Post</u></p>
									<p>My initial post outlined the ranking for which I believed best suited the impact of the eleven key assets identified in the paper by Padhy et al, which affect the reusability of object-oriented software. My ranking consisted of the top six most important factor and the remaining 5 were deemed as less impactful. After reviewing the views of my peers in regards to this topic the general consensus was that is seemed to be arbitrary to rank the individual factors based on their merits in isolation. This is due to in reality the factors are applied together to make the biggest impact on reusability. It is also clear that it depends on an individual’s perspective on which factors present the most value as amongst my peers the lists generated were all unique. Although the general consensus is that requirement analysis is the most impactful factor. 
I believe that in my initial post I discounted the other unranked 5 factors, as I only saw basic implications for each of these however test cases seemingly has a larger impact than I initially gave it. This is due to my focus on development rather than user experience and accessibility where a good and effective testing plan will help to create the best possible software, that as a whole can be reused with minor changes in the future. </p>
									<p>Overall the article by Padhy et al, has improved my understanding of the complex nature of software development having to account for not just the current project but how aspects can be  reused in order to streamline future projects. </p>

										<h2>Unit 4:  Applying a UML Model to a Program Implementation: UML in Practice </h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Reflections & Terminologies </h3>
									<p>This unit provides further practice on classes, class inheritance, abstract classes and data structures. It was interesting to me to finally be able to build the relation between the class diagram and the actual implementation. Concepts of polymorphism and variable constructors where introduced. Such concepts provide great benefits in executing the class methods upon object creation. Key terminologies as such support the development of the code structure. Apart from the initializer __int__ and method decorators, I would like to explore other constructors that can support my development of the driverless car system.  </p>
									
									<h3><u>Artefacts</u></h3>
									<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
									<p>Polymorphism is a fundamental concept of OOP and it dictates the use of an entity in different forms. There many examples of polymorphism in python that range from simple addition operators to Class methods and inheritance (Programiz 2020). Method overriding is another example of polymorphism and it dictates the inheritance of class methods and attributes to fit a child class. An example of this shown in the python syntax below: <br />
										<a href="https://github.com/TarekHamzaGoda/03_Module_3_OOP_Sep22/blob/main/01_Activities/Unit5_PolyM.py">source code</a>.</p>
									
							
									<p>The main class CAR contains class methods that will be inherited by the child class LAMBO. No methods were overridden however additional class methods were added in the child class.</p>
									<p><i><b>Note:</b>This is an example of the code that will be implemented on the autonomous car system.  </i></p>

										<h2>Unit 5: More on Classes </h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Reflections & Terminologies </h3>
									<p>During unit 5, Encapsulation was introduced. In concept, encapsulation is when class attributes and data structurer a grouped together and the access is restricted. This is when Public and Public attributes was practiced. Class attributes or class variables can be accessed from within the class using property decorator which I though is similar to abstract class decorators. However, I learned that they can be access using getters and setter’s functions. Another concept that was introduced in this unit is Data Validation. Data validation is the process of ensuring that the data type input is correct. At first, I found it difficult to make the connection between Encapsulation and Data validation. However, after practicing the below code, the syntax stared to make since.   </p>

									<p>The above syntax represents 2 class methods with a property to decorator to restrict access to the attribute and setter to change the value. Validating in this case, is performed through an exception built-in function in python. This will ensure the correct data being inputted thus the data is validated.</p>
									<h3><u>Artefacts</u></h3>
									<p>Unit 6 also explores further implementation technics in OOP. Important terminologies such as an object state and class inheritance were introduced. It was practically challenging at the first glance. Class inheritance indicates the use of a Super class and Sub class. In other words, the main class or system feature will contain attributes and methods and then the sub class will inherent those attributes and methods. This technique encourages the reusability of the syntax and provides a blueprint for future use. An example of this is shown below by creating 3 abstract class methods and one subclass for banking operations. </p>

									<h3>Reflections & Evaluation(Driverless Car System Design) </h3>
									<p>A as software engineer, am given the requirements to build a driverless car system. However, this part of the assignment requires me to only develop UML designs that showcases main software features and use cases during the pre-system implementation Phase. This assignment is considered as a great opportunity to apply the knowledge gained during previous units on UML design. First, A research was conducted on the main features of autonomous cars. which includes components such as environmental mapping, sensors and traffic recognition. As such, these components will be connected to the control unit that will interact with the driver. Several UML models were built based on the system requirement and level. 
									The complete system design is <a href="https://github.com/TarekHamzaGoda/03_Module_3_OOP_Sep22/blob/main/02_Driverless_Car/Autonumus_SystemDesign.pdf">recorded here</a>.</p>
									<h3><u>Artefacts</u></h3>
									<h3>Nested Dictionaries</h3>
									<p> OOP development are supported by data structures such as dictionaries. This exercise aims to create nested dictionary within the Class Car. Data types will be retrieved using class methods items (), keys (), and values (). The Car Class will contain a dictionary as a class attribute in which car types, makes and year will be stored. class methods will then return the data types. An object is instantiated to add the data set.

									<p>Unit 8’s theme was on understanding how data sets are compared in syntax using Union, Intersection, Difference and Symmetric. I think overall the elements in this unit will benefit me with producing an organized code structure and help understand types of data that will be include in syntax. To summarize, data set operations include the following:</p>
									<ol>
									<li><b>Union:</b> Items present in all sets</li>
									<li><b>Intersection:</b> Items the are common between 2 sets</li>
									<li><b>Difference:</b> Items that are only in 1 set</li>
									<li><b>Symmetric Difference: </b>items that are not common between 2 sets.</li>

									<h3>Forum Discussion:  Metamodel Design to support OOD of the IoT</h3>
									<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a foundational aspect of software development. Therefore, Fortino et al. (2015) introduces a new approach that aims to apply similar fundamentals to the Internet of Things (IoT).  OOP initiatives require planning and design during early development stages. systematic software design strategies such as UML, helps provide a blueprint to support the development. Similarly, Metamodel is an approach that supports analysis and implementation techniques that aids with the development of Smart objects to the IoT (Fortino, et al., 2015).
										Metamodel approaches can strongly support and identify smart object functions in different abstraction levels. Early development phases must require efforts to understand main system design, relationships, and functional components. As such, metamodel approaches can provide abstract testing grounds for features in different phases of the system. 
										Although system design planning approaches such as UML or Metamodel are supplemental factors of system development, it remains a challenge to include actual syntax within both approaches. That is because code components, functions, behaviours and algorithms are subject for constant change due to numerous factors during system implementation (Perez & Sellers 2008). A metamodel in concept provides a generalized approach of the system design. The inclusion of further implementation strategies can be time consuming and maybe inefficient.

									<p>A Code can be translated into graphs in order to calculate its complexity. This exercise will be applied on the following code.</p>

									<p>Often engineers strive for low CC results (Schults, 2021). The complexity of the code can make it difficult to read and can contribute to maintenance issues during the development cycle.</p>

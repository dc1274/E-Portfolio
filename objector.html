									<h3>Module Overview </h3>
									<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a popular approach to software development that uses objects and classes to organize code. Students will learn how to create classes and objects in Python, and use them to manipulate data. The module covers advanced topics like inheritance and polymorphism, which are used to design complex programs. Upon completion, students will have the skills to design and implement their own OOP programs. </p>	
									<h3>Learning outcomes </h3>
									<li>Appraise and critically evaluate object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms. </li>
									<li>Design and implement programs that demonstrate appropriate use of object-oriented design principles. </li>
									<li>Select and use appropriate data structures for a given problem. </li>
									<li>Propose object-oriented solutions using an appropriate modelling language, such as UML. </li>
									</ol>

										<h2>Unit 1: An Introduction to Python Programming and the OO Programming Paradigm </h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>The first unit of the module introduces the object oriented programming paradigm, the syntax and the method used to form classes in python. Also introducing the 5 major features of object oriented programming: </p>
									<li>Classes: OOP is based on the group of classes which are templates or blueprints that define the properties and behaviour of an object. </li>
								        <li>Encapsulation: is a way to hide the implementation details of an object from the outside. In OOP, data and methods are encapsulated within the class and are accessed by the methods. </li>
								        <li>Inheritance: allows for a new class to be based on an existing one. Inheriting the properties and methods. This allows for code reuse and helps to organize the code into a hierarchy. </li>								
								        <li>Polymorphism: allows objects to change to take on different forms or types </li>								
								        <li>Abstraction: is the process of removing unnecessary detail from an object, leaving only the essential characteristics. </li>										
								        <h3>Article review </h3>
								        <p> The article by Di Silvestro & Nadir (2021) discusses the topic of E-portfolios. With the benefits of making e-portfolios for students being explored in detail. The article discusses the effect that e-portfolios have on the enhancement of student experience and engagement to higher learning programs. This article is one of the first studies into finding the true value of the implementation of an e-portfolio of which presented many less commonly associated benefits such as the development of professional confidence. Personally, as a post graduate student making an e-portfolio for the first time I expected the benefits to be simply as a showcase of work and progress, however according to this article the act of building the portfolio itself helps to build many professional skills and serves as form of revision for the content learned during the course. This can help build confidence for students as it shows a clear progression in skills over duration of the module. </p>

										<h2>Unit 2: Object Oriented Analysis - Initial Steps towards Programming in Python </h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Reflections & Terminologies </h3>
									<p>Unit 3 provides a deeper understanding of different types of UML diagrams. In my opinion a class diagram is the most vital of them all. That is because the diagram presents a link between main system features and actual implementation techniques. Class diagrams provides a preview of the main classes, class variables and class objects. Classes represent main system features and its range of relationships with each other. Other UML diagrams such as sequence, activity, and state diagrams represent different stages of the software design. I think unit 3 provides an overview of all system design tools and stages.  </p>
									<h3><u>Artefacts</u></h3>
									<h3>UML models, Software Development Life Cycle</h3>
									<p>Unified modelling language or UML is a modelling technique the illustrates a detailed development process of a system (Jacobson et al. 2004). In other words, UML is a general-purposed language that tends to support a step-by-step process to achieve a practical system. UML practices is considered a good development process and is crucial to the success of a software. Therefore, there are several types of UML models thar are used in different stages of the development process.</p>
									<ol>
									<li>User Requirements Stage: Use Case Diagram, Activity Diagrams, Deployment Diagram</li>
									<li>System Implementation Stage: Class Diagram, State Machine Diagram </li>	
									<li>Development Stage: Use Case Diagram, Sequence Diagram, State Machine Diagram  </li>
									<li>Validation and Testing Stage: State Transition Diagram</li>
									<li>Packaging and publishing Stage: Activity Diagram.</li>
									</ol>

										<h2>Unit 3:  UML </h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Reflections & Terminologies </h3>
									<p>Unit 4 explores further UML techniques. There was a great emphasis on the class and activity diagrams. I have learned that there are different types of views in which every diagram is represented by. For instance, Static views include class diagram, Design view included collaboration diagram and component diagrams and use case view includes use case diagrams. In the pervious units, I have explored working with a state machine diagram and use case diagram. This unit encourages to build an activity diagram for the driverless car. </p>
									<h3><u>Artefacts</u></h3>
									<p>Activity diagrams preview a component in the system in which computational activities are involved in the work flow. The below example is an activity diagram of the driverless car system and the activity between the control unit and the Vehicle to Vehicle Communication. </p>

										<h2>Unit 4:  Applying a UML Model to a Program Implementation: UML in Practice </h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Reflections & Terminologies </h3>
									<p>This unit provides further practice on classes, class inheritance, abstract classes and data structures. It was interesting to me to finally be able to build the relation between the class diagram and the actual implementation. Concepts of polymorphism and variable constructors where introduced. Such concepts provide great benefits in executing the class methods upon object creation. Key terminologies as such support the development of the code structure. Apart from the initializer __int__ and method decorators, I would like to explore other constructors that can support my development of the driverless car system.  </p>
									
									<h3><u>Artefacts</u></h3>
									<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
									<p>Polymorphism is a fundamental concept of OOP and it dictates the use of an entity in different forms. There many examples of polymorphism in python that range from simple addition operators to Class methods and inheritance (Programiz 2020). Method overriding is another example of polymorphism and it dictates the inheritance of class methods and attributes to fit a child class. An example of this shown in the python syntax below: <br />
										<a href="https://github.com/TarekHamzaGoda/03_Module_3_OOP_Sep22/blob/main/01_Activities/Unit5_PolyM.py">source code</a>.</p>
									
							
									<p>The main class CAR contains class methods that will be inherited by the child class LAMBO. No methods were overridden however additional class methods were added in the child class.</p>
									<p><i><b>Note:</b>This is an example of the code that will be implemented on the autonomous car system.  </i></p>

										<h2>Unit 5: More on Classes </h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Reflections & Terminologies </h3>
									<p>During unit 5, Encapsulation was introduced. In concept, encapsulation is when class attributes and data structurer a grouped together and the access is restricted. This is when Public and Public attributes was practiced. Class attributes or class variables can be accessed from within the class using property decorator which I though is similar to abstract class decorators. However, I learned that they can be access using getters and setter’s functions. Another concept that was introduced in this unit is Data Validation. Data validation is the process of ensuring that the data type input is correct. At first, I found it difficult to make the connection between Encapsulation and Data validation. However, after practicing the below code, the syntax stared to make since.   </p>

									<p>The above syntax represents 2 class methods with a property to decorator to restrict access to the attribute and setter to change the value. Validating in this case, is performed through an exception built-in function in python. This will ensure the correct data being inputted thus the data is validated.</p>
									<h3><u>Artefacts</u></h3>
									<p>Unit 6 also explores further implementation technics in OOP. Important terminologies such as an object state and class inheritance were introduced. It was practically challenging at the first glance. Class inheritance indicates the use of a Super class and Sub class. In other words, the main class or system feature will contain attributes and methods and then the sub class will inherent those attributes and methods. This technique encourages the reusability of the syntax and provides a blueprint for future use. An example of this is shown below by creating 3 abstract class methods and one subclass for banking operations. </p>

									<h3>Reflections & Evaluation(Driverless Car System Design) </h3>
									<p>A as software engineer, am given the requirements to build a driverless car system. However, this part of the assignment requires me to only develop UML designs that showcases main software features and use cases during the pre-system implementation Phase. This assignment is considered as a great opportunity to apply the knowledge gained during previous units on UML design. First, A research was conducted on the main features of autonomous cars. which includes components such as environmental mapping, sensors and traffic recognition. As such, these components will be connected to the control unit that will interact with the driver. Several UML models were built based on the system requirement and level. 
									The complete system design is <a href="https://github.com/TarekHamzaGoda/03_Module_3_OOP_Sep22/blob/main/02_Driverless_Car/Autonumus_SystemDesign.pdf">recorded here</a>.</p>
									<h3><u>Artefacts</u></h3>
									<h3>Nested Dictionaries</h3>
									<p> OOP development are supported by data structures such as dictionaries. This exercise aims to create nested dictionary within the Class Car. Data types will be retrieved using class methods items (), keys (), and values (). The Car Class will contain a dictionary as a class attribute in which car types, makes and year will be stored. class methods will then return the data types. An object is instantiated to add the data set.

									<h3>Reflections Artefacts & Terminologies</h3>
									<p>Unit 8’s theme was on understanding how data sets are compared in syntax using Union, Intersection, Difference and Symmetric. I think overall the elements in this unit will benefit me with producing an organized code structure and help understand types of data that will be include in syntax. To summarize, data set operations include the following:</p>
									<ol>
									<li><b>Union:</b> Items present in all sets</li>
									<li><b>Intersection:</b> Items the are common between 2 sets</li>
									<li><b>Difference:</b> Items that are only in 1 set</li>
									<li><b>Symmetric Difference: </b>items that are not common between 2 sets.</li>

									<h3>Forum Discussion:  Metamodel Design to support OOD of the IoT</h3>
									<p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a foundational aspect of software development. Therefore, Fortino et al. (2015) introduces a new approach that aims to apply similar fundamentals to the Internet of Things (IoT).  OOP initiatives require planning and design during early development stages. systematic software design strategies such as UML, helps provide a blueprint to support the development. Similarly, Metamodel is an approach that supports analysis and implementation techniques that aids with the development of Smart objects to the IoT (Fortino, et al., 2015).
										Metamodel approaches can strongly support and identify smart object functions in different abstraction levels. Early development phases must require efforts to understand main system design, relationships, and functional components. As such, metamodel approaches can provide abstract testing grounds for features in different phases of the system. 
										Although system design planning approaches such as UML or Metamodel are supplemental factors of system development, it remains a challenge to include actual syntax within both approaches. That is because code components, functions, behaviours and algorithms are subject for constant change due to numerous factors during system implementation (Perez & Sellers 2008). A metamodel in concept provides a generalized approach of the system design. The inclusion of further implementation strategies can be time consuming and maybe inefficient.

									<h3>Reflections & Terminologies</h3>
									<p>Unit 9 elaborates on testing approaches and consistent debugging and how testing is considered a vital practice in system development. I think that testing methodologies should be invested on as it necessary for the long-term system development. This unit introduces different types of testing approaches such as manual testing, automated testing and black box testing. The purpose of this is to insure reliable software development process.</p>

									<h3>Cyclomatic Complexity</h3>
									<p>CC or cyclomatic complexity is unit that defines the possible number of paths inside a code and calculated using McCabe’s Formula:</p>
									<p><b>Complexity = Graph edges – Graph Nodes + 2(Connected Components)</b></p>

									<p>A Code can be translated into graphs in order to calculate its complexity. This exercise will be applied on the following code.</p>

									<p>Often engineers strive for low CC results (Schults, 2021). The complexity of the code can make it difficult to read and can contribute to maintenance issues during the development cycle.</p>

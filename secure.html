										<h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Secure Software Development</h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>The first unit of this module introduces the both concepts of unified modelling language (UML) and the Waterfall and Agile approaches to software development. As well as this the concepts of personal awareness and having a risk-aware culture is developed upon. As important as it is to develop software that is secure, this is only one aspect to responding to the security challenges. It is critical that the people who are internal to the organisation develop a security-responsible attitude.</p>
									
									<h3><u>Artefacts: Software development and UML </h3></u>
									
									<p>The waterfall and agile approach are two different ways to develop software. The waterfall approach is a sequential process where each step of the development cycle is completed before moving on to the next. The Agile approach is flexible and iterative, focusing on teamwork, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. The choice of approach depends on the project's requirements, complexity, and team dynamics </p>
									<p>UML is a visual language used to design, document, and explain software systems. It has standardized diagrams that represent different aspects of a system and can be used throughout the software development process to model differing perspectives of the system. UML provides developers with a standardized way to visually communicate a software system's architecture, design and behaviour. This enabling them to better understand and communicate, software systems. </p>
						
								        <h3><u>Discussion Forum </u></h3>
									<p> Broken access control is one of the 10 weaknesses identified by OWASP. Access control is a method for which the right to access data and functions are determined. It outlines the permissions of an authenticated user, this involves the polices or rules which are set in place to limit access, these can be but are not limited to the user device and location. Broken access control occurs when unauthorized access to data and content occurs. This includes viewing, altering and taking control over the administration of a site or program. Broken access control is a product of not effectively implementing when authentication and access restriction, therefore allowing for attackers/hackers to gain access to sensitive files and control over the systems. To prevent broken access control a focus on preventing configuration errors and promoting a higher standard of control access practices in development is necessary. This involves improving the security involved with user ID credentials so that attackers are unable to use other users to gain access. File permission protection is another necessary area of focus as although almost all data is stored in back end servers, with only a few locally stored files it is important that these are not publicly accessible and that most directories are not readable with even fewer being marked as executable. 
Allowing for the inclusion of different control access systems can help to provide a higher level of security that can reduce broken access control occurring by tailoring the access system specifically to the function. Such as implementing discretionary access control (DAC), role-based access control (RBAC) or mandatory access control (MAC). </p>

								<h3><u> Artefact: System Planning</u></h3>	
								<p> The second unit discusses the creation of flowcharts and how these are applied to the design stage of SDCL for the purpose of improving communication with stakeholders. Flowcharts are diagrams that represent a series of steps in a process. They can be used in the design stage of the software development process to support communication between stakeholders. Flowcharts help developers communicate design concepts in a clear manner and identify potential issues in the process. They also improve the final product's quality by ensuring it meets all requirements and is efficient as well as reliable. </p>

										<h2>Unit 3: Programming Languages: History, Concepts & Design </h2>
									</header>
									<p>The third unit discusses the fundamental concepts of a Programming languages how they became the primary tool of computer scientist while also providing an investigating the history and design. </p>								
									<p> Programming languages have evolved over time to meet the changing needs of technology and software development. The earliest programming language was machine language, which used binary code to communicate with computers. In the 1950’s, Fortran was developed as the first high-level programming language. Fast forward to the 1990’s and Java was developed as a widely used programming language designed to be platform-independent, meaning it can run on any device. These three milestones in programming language development mark significant advancements in the field and have paved the way for the development of hundreds of programming languages that exist today. </p>

						<h3><u> Artefact: Secure Programming Languages</u></h3>
						<p><u> 	What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not? </u></p>
						<p>There are several important factors that can determine whether a programming language is secure or not. Firstly the memory management of a programming language. If it provides automatic memory management, such as garbage collection, it can help prevent many security vulnerabilities related to memory allocation and deallocation. When a programming language provides strong input validation capabilities it can help prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). A programming language that can provide robust error handling mechanisms can help prevent runtime errors and buffer overflows that can be exploited by attackers. Some programming languages provide built-in security features, such as encryption libraries and authentication mechanisms that can help prevent various types of attacks. </p>
						<p> Overall, the security of a programming language depends on a combination of factors, including the language's design and implementation, the available security tools and libraries, and the skills and practices of developers who use the language to build software. </p>
						<br>
						<p><u> Could Python be classed as a secure language? </u></p>
						<p> Python, like any other programming language, has some security strengths and weaknesses to be considered when assessing whether Python can be classified as a secure language: Python provides automatic memory management, which can help prevent many memory-related vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows. Python also provides a range of built-in input validation mechanisms, such as regular expressions and string methods, which can help prevent common input-related attacks, such as SQL injection and XSS. Python also provides robust error handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks which can help prevent runtime errors that can be exploited by attackers. Python also provides several built-in security features, such as the hashlib module for encryption, the ssl module for secure socket layers, and the hmac module for message authentication. </p>
						<p> In conclusion, Python can be classified as a relatively secure language, especially when compared to some other programming languages. However, as with any language, the security of Python applications ultimately depends on the skills and practices of the developers who use the language to build software. </p>
						<br>
						<p><u> Discuss if Python would be a better language to create secure operating systems than C. </u></p>
						<p> Python is a high-level programming language, while C is a low-level programming language. As such, both languages have different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to creating secure operating systems. </p>						
						<p> C gives developers more control over memory management, which can be beneficial when creating an operating system. However, the manual memory management in C can also lead to buffer overflows, which are a common source of security vulnerabilities. Python's automatic memory management can help prevent many memory-related vulnerabilities, but it also means that developers have less control over memory management.
Python has a range of built-in input validation mechanisms, while in C, input validation must be implemented manually. Python's input validation mechanisms can help prevent common input-related attacks. Python has robust error handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks, that can help prevent runtime errors that can be exploited by attackers. C also has error handling mechanisms, but they can be more complex and may require more developer expertise. Python provides several built-in security features, such as the hashlib module for encryption and the hmac module for message authentication while C, on the other hand, does not provide any built-in security features. </p>
						<p> Overall, both Python and C have their advantages and disadvantages when it comes to creating secure operating systems. While Python's automatic memory management and built-in security features can help prevent certain types of security vulnerabilities, C's manual memory management and greater control over hardware can be beneficial in creating an operating system that is highly secure. Ultimately, the choice of language depends on the specific security requirements of the operating system and the skills and expertise of the developers who will be working on the project. </p>

						<h3><u> Discussion Forum: Summary post </u></h3>	
						<p> Broken access control is a coding weakness that occurs when an application fails to restrict access to resources or functionality based on user roles or privileges. This can allow unauthorized users to access sensitive information or perform actions they are not authorized to do. (Dalton et al, 2009) OWASP is a non-profit organization that provides information and tools for improving the security of web applications. OWASP has a list of the top 10 web application security risks, and broken access control is one of them. (OWASP, 2022)
							Other weaknesses identified by OWASP that relate to broken access control include: </p>
						<ol>
							<li> Insufficient Authentication/Authorization: This weakness occurs when an application does not properly authenticate or authorize users, which can lead to unauthorized access. </li>
							<li> Injection: Injection attacks can be used to bypass access control by manipulating input data to trick the application into granting access to unauthorized users </li>
							<li> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS attacks can be used to bypass access control by injecting malicious code into a web page, which can then be executed by an unsuspecting user who has access to sensitive information or functionality. (OWASP, 2022) </li>
							
						</ol>
						<p> Broken access control can occur due to several reasons, such as the improper configuration of access controls. Developers may not properly configure access controls for different users. This can result in users having more privileges than they should, or having access to sensitive information they should not be able to see. Also if an application fails to properly validate user input, attackers can manipulate input parameters to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access. (Dalton et al, 2009) Overall, it is essential for developers to properly implement access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or functionality. Proper validation of user input, monitoring of access attempts, and configuration of access controls for different user roles are crucial for mitigating the risks associated with broken access control. </p>

										<h2> Unit 4: Exploring Programming Language Concepts </h2>
									</header>
									<p>The fourth unit discusses the effect of the key programming concepts on system security. The focus is on two concepts in particular, the regular expressions (regex) and recursion. </p>
				<h3><u> Artefact: Regex and Recursion </u></h3>	
				<p><u> What is ReDOS and what part do ‘Evil Regex’ play? </u></p>
				<p> ReDoS stands for Regular expression Denial of Service, which is a type of vulnerability that can be exploited in applications that use regular expressions. It occurs when an attacker creates a specially crafted input that takes a long time to process and causes the application to become unresponsive or crash. The root cause of ReDoS is typically an inefficient regular expression pattern that is susceptible to exponential-time matching behaviour. </p>
				<p> Evil Regex" refers to regular expression patterns that are deliberately designed to exploit ReDoS vulnerabilities. These patterns often involve the use of repetition operators such as * and +, which can cause backtracking and exponential matching. By crafting an input that triggers this behaviour, an attacker can consume huge amounts of CPU time and cause a denial of service </p>
				<br>
				<p><u> What are the common problems associated with the use of regex? How can these be mitigated? </u></p>	
				<p> The use of regular expressions (regex) can lead to several common problems, including: ReDoS Vulnerabilities: As mentioned earlier, <b>inefficient regex patterns</b> can lead to ReDoS vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers to cause denial of service attacks. <b>False positives/negatives</b>, regular expressions are powerful tools but can be prone to producing false positives or negatives, where it either matches incorrect inputs or fails to match correct ones. <b>Limited readability</b>, complex regex patterns can be difficult to read and understand, making it challenging for other developers to maintain or modify the code. <b>Compatibility issues</b>, regular expressions can vary in syntax and behaviour across different programming languages, which can cause compatibility issues when code is transferred or reused. </p>
				<p> To mitigate these issues, developers can follow these best practices when working with regular expressions these are to limit the use of complex patterns. By using simpler patterns whenever possible, this minimizes the risk of ReDoS vulnerabilities and improve readability. By testing regular expressions with a variety of inputs, including inputs that are expected to match and those that are not. This helps to identify false positives and negatives and improve the accuracy of the regex pattern. By using tools such as regex validators to check the syntax and efficiency of the regex patterns this helps to mitigate some issues. Finally by ensuring compatibility of regular expressions across different programming languages ensures that the code can be ported or reused without issues. </p>
				<br>
				<p><u> How and why could regex be used as part of a security solution? </u></p>
				<p> Regular expressions (regex) can be used as part of a security solution to help detect and prevent security threats in a variety of ways. Regular expressions can be used to validate user input and ensure that it meets specific requirements, such as length, format, or content. This can prevent input-based attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection. Regular expressions can be utilized to search through log files and detect patterns of suspicious activity. Regular expressions can also be used to search through files or network traffic and detect patterns of malicious code or malware, such as virus signatures. Regular expressions can be used to mask sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, social security numbers. </p>
				<p> In conclusion, regular expressions are a powerful tool that can be used as part of a security solution to detect and prevent security threats in various ways. By using regex to validate input, analyse logs, detect malware, filter URLs and mask sensitive data while organizations can enhance their security posture and reduce the risk of security breaches. </p>

				<h3> Recursion </h3>
									<p>One of the classic programming problems that is often solved by recursion is the towers of Hanoi problem. <u>Read the explanation, study the code and then create your own version</u>.</p>
		<p> The Towers of Hanoi is a puzzle where you need to move a stack of disks from one peg to another, following the following rules: 	</p>	
		<ol>
			<li> Only one disk can be moved at a time </li>
			<li> No disk may ever rest atop a smaller disk.	</li>
		</ol>
			<p> This problem can be solved using recursion, which means breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems. To move n amount of disks, we can move the top n-1 disks to the temporary peg, move the largest disk to the destination peg, and then move the n-1 disks to the destination peg using the original peg as now a temporary peg. We keep repeating this process recursively until we solve the problem for the base case of moving just one disk. </p>
			<p> Below shows the python program I made that uses the concept of recursion. It can ask for the number of disks and then executes the move, finally displaying the number of moves executed to reach the solution.</p>
		
		<span class="image main"><img src="pictures/SSDUnit4.png" alt="" /></span>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/dheeranc/SECURESP/blob/source/Recursion">source code.</a></p>
	
		<p> The function towers_of_hanoi takes four total arguments, the number of disks (n), the peg from which to move the disks (from_peg), the peg to which to move the disks (to_peg), and the temporary peg to use (temp_peg). If n is 1, we simply move the disk from the from_peg to the to_peg and return 1 move. Finally, the user is asked for the number of disks, call the towers_of_hanoi function with the starting and ending pegs, and display the number of moves executed. </p>

<br>
		<h3> Regex</h3>
		<p> The UK postcode system consists of a string that contains a number of characters and numbers. Below shows a python program that implements a regex that complies with the real rules for UK post codes and tests them against the given post codes. </p>
		<span class="image main"><img src="pictures/SSDUnit4.5.png" alt="" /></span>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/dheeranc/SECURESP/blob/source/regex">source code.</a></p>

		<p> The following code shows the validity of the given test post codes that have been used for testing </p>

		<p><a href="https://github.com/dheeranc/SECURESP/blob/source/regex_results">source code.</a></p>
		<br>
		<p><u> How do you ensure your solution is not subject to an evil regex attack? </u></p>
		<p> To ensure that the solution is not subject to an evil regex attack the following solutions can be implemented. Firstly the use of a regex engine that supports anti-DoS features, as some engines have built-in anti-DoS features that can detect and prevent ReDoS attacks. For example the re2 library for Python has a feature called "safe search mode" that can be used to prevent ReDoS attacks. Secondly by using a more restrictive regex pattern this could help to reduce the probability of an evil regex attack. However, it is vital to ensure that the regex pattern used is as restrictive as possible while still allowing all valid inputs. </p>

										<h2>Unit 5: An Introduction to Testing </h2>
									</header>
								<p>The fifth unit focuses further on developing the concept of classes. It introduces and further develops the concepts of classes, inheritance and data structures. Specifically polymorphism and variable constructors developed upon, these concepts provide the ability to execute class methods based on object creation.  </p>									
									
									<h3><u>Artefact: Polymorphism </u></h3>
								
									<p> Polymorphism is a fundamental concept of object oriented programming that allows different types of objects to be treated as if they are the same type. Therefore a single method or function can be used to operate different objects as long as they share the common super class. This allows for code reusability and modularity key concept of OOP. </p>

										<h2>Unit 6: Using Linters to Support Python Testing </h2>
									</header>
									<p>The sixth unit discusses the concepts of abstract methods and interfaces. The concept of encapsulation is also introduced which involves the grouping of attributes and different data structures. An abstract method is declared in a class but does not have any implementation. This is for the purpose of providing a blueprint for its subclasses to implement the functionality of it. An interface is similar to this however an interface can only contain abstract methods and constants. </p>									
								<h3><u> Artefacts: Abstraction in Object Oriented Programming </u></h3>
								<p><u> Metrics used to assess the features of an object oriented program </u> </p>
								<p>There are several metrics used to assess the features of an object oriented program. These metrics provide a way to measure the quality of a programs design and implementation, therefore helping to identify potential issues and aspects to be improved. The most commonly used metrics used are as follows: </p>
								<ol>
								<p>Coupling, this measures the degrees of interdependence that is present between set classes of a program. A high coupling indicates that changes to one class will heavily affect others, making the program harder to change and modify. </p>
								<p> Cohesion, this measures the degree to which member of a class are related to each other. High cohesion indicated that the member of the class are closely related and work together to achieve a common goal. </p>						
								<p> Inheritance depth, this measures the number of levels inside a class hierarchy. The higher this depth the more complex and difficult it is to understand. </p>
								<p> Method complexity, this measures the difficulty of individual methods in a class. A high method complexity can indicate that a method is doing too much and may be too complex. </p>
								<p> Code coverage, this measures the amount of code that is executed during testing. High code coverage indicated that most of the code has been tested and is less likely to contains errors.  </p>
								<p> Cyclomatic complexity, this is most used metric. It measure the number of independent paths in a program. The higher the complexity the more the difficult and harder to modify or understand. </p>

This is used to allow a user to perform a three basic banking operations these are deposit, withdraw and checking the balance. While the “checking account” serves as the subclass and actually allows for the implementation of the operations for a user due to the use of “abstract method” decorator for the purpose of showing the use of the subclass. </p>

								<h3>Article Review </h3>
								<p>The article by Knox et al. (2018) discusses many the concept of a modelling management resource system in the form of Pynsim. Component based modelling as described in this article is an approach to modelling a complex system by breaking it down into smaller  components which can then be modelled and analysed separately. These components can then be combined back together to a larger system with the behaviour of the system determined via the interactions between these components. Component based modelling frameworks depend on several elements such as the component architecture, component libraries, model composition as well as verification and finally the documentation stage. 
This link to Pynsim a central focus of this paper, Pynsim is a python based simulation framework that allows for the modelling and analysis of complex dynamic systems. It is built to be flexible as well as modular. It can even provide pre built components for common systems. Pynsim includes a simulation engine that execute a model and produce outputted data. In conclusion, Pynsim is a powerful for modelling a simulating complex systems in a user friendly way and due to its python based architecture, allows for easy integration with different python libraries and tools. </p>

										<h2>Unit 7: Introduction to Operating Systems </h2>
									</header>
									<p>The seventh unit discusses the concepts of debugging and error handling as well as the concepts of data structure and searching. The seventh unit also marked the submission of the first assignment of the module which involved a accumulation of all the UML concepts previously discussed. </p>
									<br>
								<h3><u>Artefacts: Data structures</u> </h3>
									<p>Data structures are essential for object-oriented development because they enable developers to efficiently and systematically organize, store, and work with data. Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in object-oriented programming. They facilitate easier data management and manipulation by allowing developers to store collections of objects or values. Another frequently used data structure in object-oriented programming is dictionaries. They enable programmers to store data as key-value pairs, allowing for data retrieval and updating. Sets are another structure in object-oriented programming that represent a collection of unordered unique elements. They allow developers to use set operations such as union, intersection and difference.  </p>									
									<p> These data structures can be used to represent a variety of real-world objects or concepts in object-oriented programming these help to support object-oriented development by allowing developers to organize, store, and manipulate data in an efficient and structured manner. </p>
									<p> The below program shows the creation of a nested dictionary of data on cars within a Car class. The program is extended to work with the dictionary by calling the following methods: items(), keys(), values(): </p>

									<h3><u> Reflection: Design Proposal  </u></h3>
									<p> The first assignment of this modules was to make a design proposal for a piece of software that could help with the processes of a self-driving or automated car. This involved the creation of five different UML designs these included the: class, use case, sequence, activity and state diagrams. I found some of these more difficult to apply than other. The use case diagram and especially the sequence diagram were particularly difficult for me due to having less experience making these but I felt as though the finished product of these did reflect what I wanted to the best of my ability. My program that I detailed in the design documentation described a data transferring program that could take data acquired from the sensors package and send it to the correct aspects of the car system such as the navigation of perception modules to analyse. Tis would then be send to the central control unit that would make decisions on the cars current objects changing to be in line with any detections or environmental dangers. This would then be sent to the cars interface to change the steering, acceleration and deceleration. This is the basis of my program, at the begin of this task I found it difficult to start as I was concerned with trying to program the entirety of a self-driving car system. I soon realised that this was too far out of my abilities and had to limit the program to just dealing with the navigation, environmental and movement of the car by transferring data and storing data to the correct components in different data types such as lists, stacks, queues and dictionaries. </p>

										<h2>Unit 8: Cryptography and Its Use in Operating Systems </h2>
									</header>
								<p> The eight unit of the module focuses on data structures and data searching. It focuses on understanding how data sets are compared using set operation. This is useful as it can help to organize coding structure and understand different types of data.  </p>
								<h3><u>Artefact: Data Structures </u></h3>
									<p>Set operations such as Union, Intersection, Difference and Symmetric difference can be used to manipulate sets of data that represent various characteristics of the car's environment, such as its sensors, external surrounding, and driving rules. </p>
								<p>The <b>union</b> of two sets A and B is a new set that contains all the elements that are in A or B or both. For a self-driving car, the union operation could be used to combine the data from multiple sensors such as lidar, radar, and cameras, into a single set representing the car's environmental perception. </p>
								<p> The <b>intersection</b> of two sets A and B is a new set that contains all the elements that are in both A and B. For a self-driving car, the intersection operation could be used to filter conflicting data from different sensors retaining only the consistent data that represents the car's true environment. </p>
								<p> The <b>difference</b> of two sets A and B is a new set containing all the elements that are in A but not in B. For a self-driving car, the difference operation can be used to identify and remove unwanted anomalies from the environment set. </p>
								<p> The <b>symmetric difference</b> of two sets A and B is a new set containing all the elements that are in either A or B but not inside both. For a self-driving car, this can be used to compare and contrast the data from two sets, these set can be anything where the car need to detects changes or differences between modules such as perception. </p>

								<h3> Discussion Forum: Metamodel design for OO design for IoT </h3>
								<p>The article by Fortino et al. (2015) discusses the design and application of a metamodel. We can apply this information to determine the strength and weaknesses of designing a metamodel for object oriented design of the internet of things (IoT). The metamodel can provide a standardised way of designing IoT systems which can help to reduce complexity. As well as it provide an abstract view of a system which can help developers understand the system in more detail. The drawbacks of this are that metamodels can add an additional level of complexity to the design process, while at the same time the opposite can occur where processes and features are generalised for the purpose of making a metamodel. The metamodel omit certain aspects of the system and not cover all aspects of IoT design such as the security, privacy and scalability. </p>
								<p> Overall the design of metamodels for object-oriented design of the IoT can have many benefits, but it also requires consideration of its  weaknesses as well. </p>

										<h2> Unit 9: Developing an API for a Distributed Environment </h2>
									</header>
								<p>The ninth unit is a continuation on testing approaches, it reiterates how consistent debugging and testing is vital for an effective development of a system. This unit introduces different types of testing, these are: manual, automated and black box testing. These are used to ensure a viable product after the development stage. </p>
								<h3><u>Artefact: Errors and testing </u></h3>
									<p>Cyclomatic complexity is one of the most commonly used metrics for assessing the complexity of an object oriented program. It can provide a qualitative measure of the independent paths present in a program. Although useful it doesn’t not provide full view of the complexity of a program as it does not take into account code semantics or the actual design of the program. There are alternative metrics that can be used separately or alongside cyclomatic complexity these are discussed below: </p>
									<ol>
									<p>Code lines, this is a simple metric which counts the total lines of code used in the program. Although this does not always give an accurate representation due to different programming languages and they differing designs of a program but it can still provide a simple way to measure the complexity and size. </p>
										<p>The maintainability index uses multiple factors such as the cyclomatic complexity and code length to provide a metric of how simple it is to edit, maintain and update a program. The higher this index the easier it is to understand and modify. </p>
										<p>The cohesion and coupling measure the degree to which different components of a program are connected together. High cohesion and low coupling are usually signs of a good design. </p>
										<p> The general view that I’ve concluded from these paper is that the best metric depends on the situation, with the most effectively commonly being a combination of multiple metrics.  </p>

										<h2> Unit 10: From Distributed Computing to Microarchitectures </h2>
									</header>
									<p>The tenth unit focuses on the various methods and reasons for testing and debugging these link directly to the second assignment of module ‘system implementation’. </p>
						
						<h3><u>Artefact: Testing </u></h3>
									<p> Testing and debugging are essential for software development. The testing phase is the process of identifying defects and errors in the software, while the debugging phase is the process of fixing said errors. The following are the stages are the different types of testing and debugging that can be implemented: </p>
					
						<ol>
							<p> <b>Unit Testing</b>, is a type of testing that tests the individual units or components of the software. It is usually conducted in the coding phase of development. The purpose of unit testing is to identify and fix errors and defects in individual units before the integration into a larger system.	</p>	
							<p> <b>Integration Testing</b>, involves testing the interaction between differing units or components of the software. This type of testing helps identify defects that arise due to interactions between components.</p>										
							<p> <b>System Testing</b>, is the process of testing the entire software system as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. </p>
							<p> <b>Acceptance Testing</b>, is the process of testing the software to ensure that it meets the user's requirements and expectations. It is usually conducted via the client.</p>
							<p> <b>Performance Testing</b>, is a type of testing that tests the performance and responsiveness of the software under different conditions.</p>
							<p> <b>Security Testing</b>, is a type of testing that tests the security of the software and identifies any vulnerabilities or weaknesses that may be exploited. </p>
							<p> <b>Debugging</b>, Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing defects and errors in the software. </p>
						</ol>	
						<p> In conclusion the testing and debugging phase is critical in ensuring the quality and reliability of the software, and it should be conducted thoroughly to reduce the risk of defects and errors in software. </p>						
						
						<br>
						<h3> Discussion forum: Summary post </h3>
						<p> After the initial discussion posts from my peers about the topic of object oriented design of IoT system, it seems the general consensus was that metamodels present value to the design process however does have some major drawbacks. </p>
						<p> Two major strengths statued in the initial post are as follows. The metamodel can provide a standardised way of designing IoT systems which can help to reduce complexity. As well as it provide an abstract view of a system which can help developers understand the system in more detail. Something that I initially missed in my initial post was some other  key benefits of metamodel design which links directly to OOP, that being reusability and flexibility.
The metamodel can help identify common patterns and reusable components of the system which can help to reduce the development time and resources. While the meta model can support multiple implementations and platforms. This can improve the flexibility and adaptability. </p>
						<p> The rest of my views regarding the weakness remain relatively the same these being, that metamodels can add an additional level of complexity to the design process, while at the same time the opposite can occur where processes and features are generalised for the purpose of making a metamodel. </p>
